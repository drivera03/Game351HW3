The different features that are added to our unity project are
1. Shoot with the F key 
2. Two different camera views (T key)
3. The enemy shoots back at the player and also follows the player
4. Player can kick and there are 3 different animation

What we are missing:
(1) Monsoon (optional)
(2) Freeswitch Camera (Og I am kinda lost on how to do this) when holding right-click - prob something with cinemachine
(3) Dolly scene (I can't code it to switch from cutscene to dolly, then to character)

Possible Errors;
(1) The player can still move during cutscene I think we just need a script that disables the character until ESC is pressed
